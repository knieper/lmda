Installing the Set User Data plugin
===================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is an example for the 1.0 version of the plugin:

   $ cd plugins
   $ tar -zxvf set_user_data-1.0.tar.gz

2) Decide if you want to store the plugin configuration file in the plugin
   directory or in the main SquirrelMail config directory.

   A) To store the configuration file in the plugin directory, change into
      the set_user_data directory, copy config.php.sample to config.php and
      and edit config.php, making adjustments as necessary.

      $ cd set_user_data
      $ cp config.php.sample config.php
      $ vi config.php

   B) To store the configuration file in the main SquirrelMain config
      directory, change into the set_user_data directory, copy
      config.php.sample to ../../config/config_set_user_data.php
      and edit ../../config/config_set_user_data.php, making adjustments
      as necessary.

      $ cd set_user_data
      $ cp config.php.sample ../../config/config_set_user_data.php
      $ vi ../../config/config_set_user_data.php

3) In the previous step, at least one data access method should have been
   selected in main configuration file. You now must configure the settings
   for this data handler. Go to the methods directory and copy the
   appropriate sample settings file and edit it as necessary. For example,
   if using the passwd method:

     $ cd methods
     $ cp passwd.php.sample passwd.php
     $ vi passwd.php

   If you want to store this configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
   directory, adjust these commands as follows:

     $ cd methods
     $ cp passwd.php.sample ../../../config/config_set_user_data_passwd.php
     $ vi ../../config/config_set_user_data_passwd.php

   If multiple methods have been set in the main configuration file, then
   this step must be repeated for each method (See the comments in the main
   configuraiton file for information on how to use more than one handler
   and/or to use a handler with more than one set of config values).

4) Go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option 8 and move
   the plugin from the "Available Plugins" category to the "Installed
   Plugins" category. Save and exit.

     $ cd ../../config/
     $ ./conf.pl


5) (OPTIONAL) If you want to prevent users from changing their email address
   and/or name in outging mail, when in the configuration tool, select
   option "4. General Options" and set "Allow editing of identity" and/or
   "Allow editing of name" to false.



Upgrading
=========

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is an example for the 1.0 version of the plugin:

   $ cd plugins
   $ tar -zxvf set_user_data-1.0.tar.gz

2) Change into the set_user_data plugin directory and check your config.php
   file against the new version to see if there are any new settings that
   you must add to your config.php file.

   $ diff -u config.php config.php.sample

   If you store your configuration file in the main SquirrelMail config
   directory, adjust this command as follows:

   $ diff -u ../../config/config_set_user_data.php config.php.sample

   Or simply replace your configuration file with the provided sample and
   reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the installation
   procedure above).

3) Change into the setting directory and repeat step 2 for each of the
   data methods in use.
