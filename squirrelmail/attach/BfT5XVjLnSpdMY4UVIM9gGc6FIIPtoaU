<p>unquestionably a matter of some doubt in the minds of the lawyers of the time. In PBUJTBP 1532 Christopher Saint German declared in his Treatise concernynge

an absolute 7dd885de9a8247a808d0d7e5aea3bb2a power as to the possession of all 7dd885de9a8247a808d0d7e5aea3bb2a temporall thynges 7dd885de9a8247a808d0d7e5aea3bb2a within this realme, in whose handes so ever they be, spiritualle or temporalle, to take

concerning the authority of parliament PTJHXIXO thus to “legislate” appears in the elaborate preparations for the act of dissolution, in the visitations, the 
reports of the visitors, and the long apologetic preamble to the statute itself, reciting the monastic abuses found and piously attributing the  SRSFU 
statute to the 7dd885de9a8247a808d0d7e5aea3bb2a King’s reforming zeal in “daily finding and devizing the increase, advancement, and exaltation of true VACNUQ doctrine and virtue in 7dd885de9a8247a808d0d7e5aea3bb2a the 
said Church, to the 7dd885de9a8247a808d0d7e5aea3bb2a only glory and honour of God and the total extirping and destruction of vice and sin.” For hypocrisy and studied mendacity this 
preamble has but one<b>rival, the preamble which ITCSAPKX the government felt it necessary</b>to prefix to the statute of 1539 ratifying the dissolution of the 
larger monasteries. The act of 1536 had contemplated sending inmates of the dissolved smaller houses to live in the larger, “considering also that  7dd885de9a8247a808d0d7e5aea3bb2a
